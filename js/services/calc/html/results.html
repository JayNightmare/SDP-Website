    <h4><strong>What your result means</strong></h4>
    <br>
    <ul id="result-meaning" style="display: block;">
        <li
        ><strong>90+ mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Normal or High Function)
            <p>What it means: Your kidneys are functioning normally. No signs of chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>
            <p>Next steps: Continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regular check-ups are recommended if you’re at risk of kidney disease.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>60-89 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Mildly Decreased Function)
            <p>What it means: Mildly reduced kidney function. This could be normal for older adults but may indicate early CKD.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Speak with your doctor if you have other risk factors for kidney disease (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>45-59 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Mild to Moderate Decrease)
            <p>What it means: There is mild to moderate kidney damage. This is classified as stage 3A CKD.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Consult your healthcare provider for further tests, monitoring, and lifestyle changes to prevent further decline.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>30-44 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Moderate to Severe Decrease)
            <p>What it means: Moderate to severe reduction in kidney function. This is classified as stage 3B CKD.</p>
            <p>Next steps: A healthcare professional may recommend additional tests, medications, or specialist care to manage the condition.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>15-29 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Severe Decrease)
            <p>What it means: Severe loss of kidney function. This is classified as stage 4 CKD, indicating significant kidney damage.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Close monitoring and preparation for possible dialysis or transplant may be necessary. Contact a nephrologist immediately.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong><15 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> (Kidney Failure)
            <p>What it means: End-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Your kidneys are no longer able to function properly.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Immediate medical attention is required. Treatment options may include dialysis or kidney transplantation.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Pediatric Ranges -->
    <ul id="result-meaning-pediatric" style="display: none;">
        <li><strong>>90 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> — Normal kidney function for children 2+ years
            <p>What it means: Your child's kidneys are functioning at normal levels.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Continue regular check-ups with your pediatrician.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>80–89 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> — Slightly reduced; may still be normal in some pediatric ranges
            <p>What it means: Slightly reduced kidney function, but may be within normal range for some children.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Discuss with your pediatrician during next visit.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>60–79 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> — Mild reduction; consider monitoring
            <p>What it means: Mild reduction in kidney function that requires attention.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Schedule a follow-up with your pediatrician for further evaluation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>30–59 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> — Moderate reduction; may require medical evaluation
            <p>What it means: Moderate decrease in kidney function that needs medical attention.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Consult with a pediatric nephrologist for detailed evaluation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong><30 mL/min/1.73m²</strong> — Possible severe kidney dysfunction in pediatric patients
            <p>What it means: Significant decrease in kidney function requiring immediate attention.</p>
            <p>Next steps: Seek immediate medical attention from a pediatric kidney specialist.</p>
        </li>
